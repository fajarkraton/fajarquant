# Changelog

All notable changes to FajarQuant are documented in this file.

The repo started as a KV cache quantization library (Arm B, paper v3.1)
and expanded with the Phase D IntLLM training-quantization research line
in v0.4.0. Going forward, both arms coexist; Phase D is the primary
research direction, KV quant is a mature paper artifact.

## [Unreleased] — V32-prep F.11 + F.5.1.6/7 + F.13 + F.13.1 + F.13.1-v2 chains + F.11 demotion

**F.11 chain DEMOTED to PERMANENT-DEFERRED (2026-05-01).** Per F.13.3
dispatch verdict (decision-doc §11), FajarOS Nova's deployment workload
(batch=1, ≤100M params) is well-served by F.11.3 scalar Rust BitLinear path
(50-100 tok/s on Mini, 10/10 tests passing). TL2 acceleration (projected
200-400 tok/s) would be 3-5× faster but is **NOT critical-path** for any
planned FajarOS deployment.

After ~31 cumulative hours across F.11.0-3 setup, F.11.4 parity iterations
1-7 + Path B, Tier 2E kernel disassembly, and Branch X-real attempted
verbatim port: parity gap unresolved (row-uniform `+32, -31, -1` cycle on
all 64 rows of `parity_real_mlp_one_tile_at_mini_256_256`). Branch X-real
blocked by upstream encoder structural gap — `preprocess_weights_tl2` raises
`NotImplementedError` for K=256 (only supports KEMD=1536, KGQA=4096). Each
hour from iteration 6 onward eliminated hypotheses but did not close
parity. Diminishing-returns analysis in `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_BRANCH_X_REAL_FINDINGS.md`
§4-5 documents the cost-to-close ratio.

  Re-entry conditions (any one triggers reactivation):
  1. Paper v2 reviewer requests bit-exact TL2 parity
  2. FajarOS workload shifts where scalar tok/s is insufficient
  3. Microsoft/BitNet upstream ships encoder for custom shapes
  4. Contributor volunteers kernel-disassembly bandwidth

  What ships AS-IS (no regression):
  - Vendored microsoft/BitNet TL2 AVX2 kernel (75 KB MIT-licensed)
  - cc-crate build chain (linkable, smoke binary works)
  - Rust FFI shim with 64-byte alignment + shape pre-validation
  - Magnitude byte encoding (bit-exact, sentinel tests pass)
  - F.11.3 scalar Rust BitLinear baseline (10/10 tests, production path)
  - 60+ cpu_kernels::tl2 unit tests
  - Cross-references in fajaros-x86 kernel ELF (`fjq_tl2_*` extern decls)

  What stays infrastructure-only / NOT activated:
  - `fjq_tl2_qgemm_lut` runtime invocation in production code path
  - Sign byte encoding (~80% of observed parity gap unattributed)
  - Paper v2 fajarquant TL2-acceleration claim (was: deferred; now: future-work)

  Documents:
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_BRANCH_X_REAL_FINDINGS.md` — Branch X-real
    closeout (1.5h actual / 6-8h grant; 4.5-6.5h budget bank UNUSED)
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_TIER2E_KERNEL_DISASSEMBLY_FINDINGS.md` — earlier
    Tier 2E kernel disassembly findings (2.5h)
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_TAX_VERTICAL_ROADMAP.md` §F.11 status block updated
    with PERMANENT-DEFERRED label + 4-condition re-entry gate

  Cross-repo impact:
  - fajaros-x86 plan §3.10 needs status flip: F.11 closure removed from
    critical-path (separate commit in fajaros-x86 repo)
  - CLAUDE.md (fajar-lang) V31.3 → V31.4 footer reflects demotion

  No code reverted; F.11 infrastructure is shipping-ready foundation.
  Next session unblocks for paper v2 narrative, founder external arXiv
  actions, F.6.4 / F.10 GPU research, or other Phase F work.



**F.13.1 v2 (2026-05-01) — Tier 2D enhancement: kvcache + torch.compile +
GPU clock stabilization. Two material findings flip parts of v1 reading:**

  1. **v1 cold-GPU artifact corrected.** Bench script now does 50-matmul
     pre-warmup before any timing. Naive path on identical code goes from
     19.7 tok/s (v1, immediately-post-driver-restoration cold GPU) to
     118.9 tok/s (v2, warm steady-state). Two consecutive runs gave
     stable 120.2 / 158.1 then 118.9 / 157.8 → ~1% variance on warm.

  2. **Optimized-best lands ABOVE literature anchor band.**
       GPU naive (warm)              = 118.9 tok/s (1.00x)
       GPU + KV cache                = 157.8 tok/s (1.33x)
       GPU + KV cache + compile(default) = 202.6 tok/s (1.70x BEST)
       GPU + KV cache + compile(reduce-overhead) = FAIL
         (HGRN init_state in-place state += breaks CUDAGraphs even with
         cudagraph_mark_step_begin marker; upstream model-code change
         required to fix; documented as known limitation)

  3. **Verdict G3 cushion has vanished with measurement.** Original
     projection: CPU-TL2 (200) - GPU upper (120) = +80 tok/s margin.
     v2 measurement: CPU-TL2 (200 still projection) - GPU best
     (202.6) = -2.6 tok/s. Static-rule verdict STILL HOLDS for FajarOS
     Nova because (a) GPU dispatch path is not built — multi-week
     engineering investment, (b) CPU-TL2 upper bound projection 400
     still exceeds 202.6, (c) FajarOS workload is batch=1 inside
     verdict G1 envelope. Cushion analysis fully documented in
     decision-doc §11.

  Files:
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_1_FINDINGS.md` — added §9 v2 update with
    4-path comparison table, torch.compile failure analysis,
    cushion vanishing finding, fixture-change list
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_DISPATCH_DECISION.md` — added §11 cushion
    analysis with 3 reasons static-rule holds + paper v2 §6 Option A
    (concise) and Option B (precise) text alternatives + cross-repo
    impact note for fajaros-x86 plan §3.4
  - `tests/fixtures/f13_dispatch_anchors.toml` — REPLACED
    `[gpu_hgrn_bit_mini_batch1_measured]` (19.7 → 118.9 warm-state),
    ADDED `[gpu_hgrn_bit_mini_batch1_optimized_best]` (202.6),
    tightened I5 floor (5 → 50), added I6 invariant +
    `i6_above_floor_acknowledged=true` flag
  - `scripts/verify_f13_dispatch.py` — added I6 check with
    acknowledgment-pattern (WARN if optimized > CPU-TL2 floor 200
    AND not acked; PASS if acked or below floor)
  - `python/phase_d/scripts/bench_f13_dispatch_calibration.py` —
    refactored: `bench_decode` → `bench_decode_naive`, added
    `bench_decode_kvcache`, `bench_decode_kvcache_compiled` (with
    fallback chain default → reduce-overhead), 50-matmul GPU pre-
    warmup phase, comparison table output, anchor cross-check that
    flags above-band cases
  - `paper/intllm/results/f13_dispatch_calibration.json` — multi-path
    measurement artifact (host envelope, model config, all 4 GPU
    paths with median/mean/p95 timing, CPU error)
  - `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` — summary line 21/21 → 23/23
    (anchor completeness +1, I6 check +1)

  Verify gate: 21 → 23 PASS strict (anchor completeness +1, I6 +1).

  Cross-repo impact (NOT actioned this commit, surfaced for next
  fajaros-x86 plan revision): `FAJAROS_PRODUCTION_PLAN_V1.md` §3.4
  LLM benchmarks close-plan should cite v2 measured numbers (118.9
  naive, 158 kvcache, 203 optimized) as GPU dispatch targets.

  Variance: ~2h actual vs 2-3h estimate, 0% to -33% (single-session
  with 2 stable bench runs + 1 cold-artifact discovery).



**F.13.1 live calibration — CLOSED PARTIAL on this hardware (after nvidia
driver restoration 2026-04-30)**: GPU measured 19.7 tok/s median (50.68 ms/tok)
on RTX 4090 Laptop, Mini × batch=1, PyTorch 2.6.0+cu124 with HGRN-Bit upstream
triton, no KV cache. CPU bench structurally blocked — HGRN-Bit triton kernels
are CUDA-only (`ValueError: Pointer argument cannot be accessed from Triton`).
Verdict G3 (GPU margin ≥50 tok/s below CPU-TL2) **REINFORCED**: original
projection margin 80-320 tok/s grows to 180-380 tok/s with measured GPU 4-6×
below optimized-stack anchor band.

  Documents:
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_1_FINDINGS.md` — full findings: §1 setup, §2 results
    (GPU measured + CPU triton failure), §3 cross-check vs anchor band (4-6×
    gap explained: triton overhead × 6 layers × no KV cache vs optimized
    llama.cpp/vLLM stack reference), §4 updated verdict matrix (G3 reinforced),
    §5 fixture update plan, §6 decision-doc update plan, §7 explicit
    deferred-work catalog (F.13.2 still deferred).

  Fixture (`tests/fixtures/f13_dispatch_anchors.toml`):
  - NEW `[gpu_hgrn_bit_mini_batch1_measured]` — measured anchor 19.7 tok/s
    median + 50.68 ms/token median + 87.17 ms p95, with explicit
    "HGRN-Bit specific, no KV cache" note.
  - UPDATED `[gpu_small_model_batch1_decode]` — kept 80-120 band but added
    `note` field clarifying it's the OPTIMIZED-stack projection target.

  Decision-doc (`docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_DISPATCH_DECISION.md`):
  - NEW §10 "Post-publication update — F.13.1 live bench 2026-04-30":
    measurement summary, why verdict is reinforced not invalidated, fixture
    additions, F.13.2 still deferred.

  Tooling:
  - `python/phase_d/scripts/bench_f13_dispatch_calibration.py` — repro bench
    (5 warmup + 64 timed greedy decode tokens, batch=1, captures median +
    mean + p95 ms/tok, saves JSON).
  - `paper/intllm/results/f13_dispatch_calibration.json` — calibration
    artifact (host envelope, model config, GPU result, CPU error).

  Pre-flight: nvidia driver restored same-day via dpkg upgrade chain
  (`linux-modules-nvidia-595-open-6.17.0-22-generic` prebuilt, dkms 595
  also installed for kernel-update resilience). RTX 4090 Laptop visible,
  CUDA 13.2 ABI exposed, 16 GB VRAM.

**F.13 Branch Z-narrow — CPU-vs-GPU dispatch heuristic ships
infrastructure-only with verdict**: static rule "CPU default; GPU
optional for batch ≥ 8." Resume-protocol pivot from F.11 chain
(parity gap unresolved). Z-narrow scope = F.13.0 + F.13.3 +
F.13.5 (no live measurements; nvidia driver absent in this
environment, F.11 TL2 parity blocks live TL2 bench). Architecture-
derived verdict anchored to public reference numbers (BitNet 2B4T
29 ms/tok, cudaLaunch 10-30 µs, GPU small-model batch=1
80-120 tok/s).

  Documents:
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_FINDINGS.md` — F.13.0 pre-flight audit
    closeout: hardware survey (i9-14900HX 32T 5.8GHz, GPU driver
    absent, RTX 4090L expected envelope), Phase D ckpt
    inventory (Mini 22M, Base 46.45M, Medium 74.52M),
    measurement infrastructure inventory, 6 pinned literature
    anchors, deferred-work catalog, 8/8 §6.8 self-check.
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` — Branch Z-narrow
    plan v1.0: scope (in: F.13.0/3/5; out: F.13.1/2 deferred),
    sub-task table with runnable verification per §6.8 R2,
    mechanical decision gates G1/G2/G3 with verdict matrix per
    §6.8 R6, 6-row risk register, 10/10 §6.8+§6.6 self-check.
    Surprise budget +25% (5.5h × 1.25 = 7h cap).
  - `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_DISPATCH_DECISION.md` — F.13.3
    decision-doc closeout: §1 inputs, §2 architectural
    decomposition (per-token cost CPU TL2 / scalar / GPU),
    §3 crossover analysis (batch axis crossover≈8, model
    axis≈5B, seq axis≈4096), §4 cost model formalization
    (piecewise-constant, embedded-friendly), §5 verdict
    3/3 PASS → static rule with N=8, §5.2 F.13.2 re-entry
    gates, §6 commodity-framework comparison table,
    §7 paper v2 §6 LaTeX-ready snippet, §8 honest limitations.

  Prevention (F.13.5 per §6.8 R3):
  - `tests/fixtures/f13_dispatch_anchors.toml` — 6 pinned
    anchors + 4 dispatch invariants (I1-I4) with sources +
    verified date + revisit_at + tolerance bands.
  - `scripts/verify_f13_dispatch.py` — fixture loader +
    invariant assertions (I1 TL2/scalar ≥ 2.4×, I2 CPU-TL2
    minus GPU ≥ 50 tok/s margin, I3 cudaLaunch×kernels ≥
    720 µs, I4 FajarOS envelope inside CPU-wins region) +
    decision-doc reference regex sanity. `--strict` exits 1
    on warn for CI/pre-commit. 19/19 PASS.
  - `Makefile` — `verify-f13-decision` target, listed in
    Phase F help section.
  - `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` — bumped to V4. Layer 5
    fires conditionally when staged paths touch
    `tests/fixtures/f13_dispatch_anchors.toml`,
    `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F13_*.md`, or
    `scripts/verify_f13_dispatch.py`. Final summary line
    appends `f13-dispatch 19/19` when triggered.

  Scope deferred (catalogued, not hidden):
  - F.13.1 live calibration sweep — needs nvidia driver +
    F.11 parity for TL2 datapoint.
  - F.13.2 runtime dispatch implementation — F.13.2-A and
    F.13.2-B re-entry gates documented (deployment ask
    with batch ≥ 8 AND F.11 parity closed).

**F.5.1.6 G5 forward-equivalence gate** (`6987de3`) — closes the
§3.3 action item from F.5.1.6 findings.
`SmoothQuantCalibrator.validate_forward_equivalence` deepcopies
the model + measures pre/post Δ-loss on a probe batch; catches
Run-7-style cumulative saturation that per-layer §4.6 gates miss.
4 unit tests + wired into `eval_smoothquant_posthoc` with
`--g5-threshold` flag.

**F.5.1.7 Branch A pre-flight audit** (`d9f92bb`) — verdict
**NO-GO Branch A primary, GO Branch B default** based on three
load-bearing pieces of literature: BitNet v2 Table 5 (ternary +
Hadamard weight-fusion ties or hurts at 1.3B/3B), MambaQuant 21%
drop on Mamba at W8A8, ZERO published QuaRot on HGRN-family.
Plus F.5.1's RMSNorm γ pre-absorption finding neutralizes
QuaRot's strongest lever. Mechanical re-entry gates GATE A1/A2/A3
specified.

**F.11 chain — vendored microsoft/BitNet TL2 AVX2 kernel + FFI
infrastructure** (15 fajarquant + 2 fajaros-x86 + 1 Fajar Lang
commits, ~23h cumulative work, infrastructure-only landing):

  Build + integration:
  - `cpu_kernels/bitnet_tl2/` — vendored microsoft/BitNet TL2
    (75 KB MIT-licensed source; attribution in
    `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`); cc-crate `build.rs` +
    `BITNET_OMIT_TRANSFORM` gate + freestanding-safe weak
    `memset` stub
    [`a098631`, `ea8b10a`, `41621a4`, `98ed310`, `5031e29`]
  - `src/cpu_kernels/tl2.rs` — Rust shim with 64-byte alignment +
    shape pre-validation (5 unit tests + preprocessor FFI smoke)
    [`fffb9b7`, `73a8a45`]
  - `src/cpu_kernels/scalar_baseline.rs` — Phase D scalar
    BitLinear baseline ported to Rust (250 LOC, 10 tests)
    [`2d2ab47`]
  - `cpu_kernels/bitnet_tl2/codegen/codegen_tl2.py` — vendored
    microsoft/BitNet codegen with `fajarquant_mini`
    ModelShapeDict entry covering all 4 Mini BitLinear shapes
    [`41621a4`]
  - **fajaros-x86 Makefile `$(TL2_O)` target** + ld step
    inclusion + `@ffi extern("C")` decls in
    `kernel/compute/matmulfree.fj`
    [fajaros-x86 `ac68866`, `7d1de9a`] — TL2 symbols at known
    addresses in `fajaros-llvm.elf`:
    `T fjq_tl2_preprocessor @0x1066f0`,
    `T fjq_tl2_qgemm_lut @0x109010`,
    `T fjq_tl2_self_test @0x106700`

  Encoders + parity work:
  - `python/phase_d/scripts/repack_to_tl2.py` (370 LOC, 23 tests)
    + tile-organized layout extension; iteration 6 sign packing
    derived from kernel `slli_epi16(vec_sign, 4*k+sub)` pattern
    [`a098631`, `57bf7a9`, `b53ede3`, `b5a7471`, `1a52f90`]
  - `src/cpu_kernels/tl2_encoder.rs` — Rust port mirroring Python
    encoder (315 LOC, 11 tests)
    [`56a69d2`, `b5a7471`, `1a52f90`]
  - `parity_real_mlp_one_tile_at_mini_256_256` Rust test
    (#[ignore]'d) — end-to-end V31 → TL2 → AVX2 → C[i] vs
    `scalar_baseline::bitlinear_packed_scalar` comparison
    [`328052b`]

  **What works:**
  - Vendored kernel + FFI symbols linked into FajarOS Nova ELF
  - Magnitude byte encoding bit-exact (verified by sentinel +
    hand-computed-offset tests across Python + Rust)
  - 50/50 fajarquant lib + 33/33 Python tests PASS
  - Smoke binary + preprocessor smoke run end-to-end through AVX2

  **What's still BLOCKED (paper v2 narratives DEFERRED):**
  - Bit-exact parity test fails 64/64 with consistent
    sign-flip-symmetric diffs — magnitude correct, sign-bit
    position has ~18 residual error per row after iteration 6
    derivation + iteration 7 hypothesis exploration (H5/H6/H8
    rejected; H7 untried).
  - `make test-intllm-kernel-path` regression NOT yet run with
    TL2 dispatch — fajaros-x86 builds and links the static lib
    but no production code path calls `fjq_tl2_qgemm_lut`
    (would crash on parity gap).
  - F.11.5 tok/s benchmark + F.11.6 findings + paper v2 §6
    hardware-perf table — gated on parity closure.

  **Strategic decision branches** (per
  `docs/FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_CHAIN_CLOSURE.md` +
  `FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_BRANCH_X_ENCODER_LOCATION.md` +
  `FJQ_PHASE_F_F11_X7_HYPOTHESIS_FINDINGS.md`):
  - Path A: try H7 ai-ordering reversal (~1h); cheapest
  - Path B: kernel disassembly inspection (~2-3h, exceeds budget)
  - Path C: accept gap, pivot to F.13 dispatch heuristic OR
    arXiv founder actions

  **F.11.4 Path B advancement** (`429a171..a296c4f`, 2026-04-30,
  +3.5h): three commits restored F.11 chain narrative and tightened
  the parity gap from "structural unknown" to "well-defined
  row-uniform residual":

  - `429a171` — `facb256` reversed. Empirical kernel-header re-read
    proved BK=256 is the three-path dispatch arm (line 1303), NOT
    BK=128 as facb256 had claimed. After reverting BK=128 → BK=256,
    baseline `C[0]` flips from 0 (no kernel ran) to -333 (kernel
    fires correctly). Iter 5/6/7's `32, -31, -1` diff cycle
    RESTORED as REAL kernel output, not memory garbage. Iter 6
    bit_pos=15 prediction CONFIRMED for row 0/triplet 0.

  - `4064c3e` — Byte→row lane-cross fix. New diagnostic
    `derive_byte_to_row_mapping` empirically derived the kernel's
    AVX2 unpacklo/unpackhi byte routing:
      `bp=0..7→C[0..7]`, `bp=8..15→C[16..23]` (cross),
      `bp=16..23→C[8..15]` (cross), `bp=24..31→C[24..31]`.
    Encoder fix in Rust + Python places row r's mag at
    `byte_in_vec(r%32)` not `r%32`. A/B test: without fix, rows
    8-23 had wild scrambled diffs (±443/±126/±97); with fix, ALL
    64 rows show row-uniform `+32, -31, -1` cycle.

  - `a296c4f` — ai=8 false-positive resolved. New diagnostic
    `probe_ai_block_with_nonzero_b` uses monotonic non-zero
    activations (b[i]=1.0+0.1·i) so LUT[idx=13] cannot cancel.
    With monotonic b, ai=8 produces +174 to C[0] — confirming
    the prior "ai=8 dropped" finding from the cycling -8..7
    activation b_buf was activation noise. ai=20 confirmed truly
    dropped (kernel inner loop bound).

  **Updated F.11 chain status (after Path B advancement):**
  - ✅ Magnitude byte→row lane-cross fix verified (rows 8-23 unscrambled)
  - ✅ Sign bit_pos=15 confirmed for row 0/triplet 0
  - ✅ ai=8/ai=20 drop accounting clarified (only ai=20 dropped)
  - ⚠ Row-uniform residual `+32, -31, -1` cycle UNRESOLVED.
    Hypotheses narrowed but full explanation requires kernel
    disassembly (Path B continuation, ~2-3h beyond budget). One
    unexplained finding: zeroing the sign buffer changes row 0's
    tl2 from 32 to 316 despite row 0 having all sign_bit=0
    (period 0). Suggests deeper kernel-state interaction.

**Cumulative variance**: −47% on aggregate F.11 chain
(infrastructure burn 12.75h vs 24h budget; full chain including
parity 28h vs 24h, +4h overrun, at "milestone closure" point).
Per-iteration variances in individual commit messages.

**Verdict per CLAUDE.md §6.6 R1 (honest end-to-end):** F.11 ships
as "infrastructure complete with documented row-uniform parity
gap" milestone. Future work (closing the residual via kernel
disassembly) is NOT in V32-prep scope. Recommended bandwidth
pivot: F.13 dispatch heuristic, founder arXiv actions, OR F.10
GPU 2:4 Sparse-BitNet.

## [0.4.0] "Phase D IntLLM" — 2026-04-24

V31.C Phase D IntLLM (1.58-bit MatMul-Free LLM training quantization)
research line shipped. Three calibrated training gates PASS with
monotonically widening margins (0.12 → 0.21 → 0.28 nat). Track B 5+1
layer interruption-safety hardening validated end-to-end during a real
laptop-shutdown event mid-Medium training. In-kernel deployment via
[FajarOS Nova v3.9.0 IntLLM Kernel Path](https://github.com/fajarkraton/fajaros-x86/releases/tag/v3.9.0).

### Added — Phase D IntLLM (training-quant research line)

**Architecture + training (V31.C.P1-P5):**
- **`intllm/model.py`** — HGRNBitForCausalLM 1.58-bit ternary architecture
  (custom MatMul-Free LLM, eliminates V31.R3 γ-cascade observed in Gemma 3 path).
- **`intllm/quant.py`** — SigmoidLUT + SiLULUT + IntRMSNorm + `fake_quantize_absmax_ste`
  (V31.C.P2.1 conditional PASS on `ridger/MMfreeLM-370M` re-eval; 5/6 tasks within ±1.53).
- **`intllm/qat.py`** — BitLinearStatTracker + adaptive bits + channel permutation
  per CLAUDE.md §6.9 R5 (outlier handling non-negotiable for LLM quantization).
- **`intllm/tokenizer.py`** + **`intllm/data.py`** — Mistral v3 32K tokenizer +
  SlimPajama-6B streaming loader (V31.C.P3, steady-state 1.3M tok/s).
- **`intllm/train.py`** — TrainConfig + `LambdaLR` scheduler (linear warmup +
  cosine decay to 10%) + `train_loop` with metric tracking.

**Training drivers (V31.C.P2-P7):**
- `python/phase_d/scripts/train_mini.py` — 21.5M params, 491M tokens (22.8 tok/p)
- `python/phase_d/scripts/train_base.py` — 46.4M params, 982M Chinchilla-optimal
- `python/phase_d/scripts/train_medium.py` — 74.5M params, 1.819B tokens (24.4 tok/p)

**3 calibrated gates PASS (V31.C.P4-P8):**
- Mini v2: val_loss 4.38 / PPL 80.0 / gate < 4.5 / margin **0.12 nat**
- Base c.1: val_loss 3.99 / PPL 54.1 / gate < 4.2 / margin **0.21 nat** (3× wider than c.2's 0.071 nat)
- Medium c.1: val_loss 3.72 / PPL 41.3 / gate < 4.0 / margin **0.28 nat** (1.33× wider than Base c.1)
- All PASS — monotonic widening on both val_loss and margin per scale step.

  (§6.8 R6 8-YES checklist).

**Track B 5+1-layer interruption-safety (V31.C.P6.1–P6.6):**
1. `ckpt_every` — atomic write (`.tmp` + `os.replace`) + rotation (P6.1)
2. `--resume` / `--resume-auto` — bit-exact state restore: model + optimizer +
   LR scheduler + step counter (P6.2)
3. `StepWatchdog` — daemon thread SIGTERMs main if step counter idle > 1800s,
   single-shot + warmup-aware (P6.3)
4. HF timeout + `_retry_iter` — `HF_DATASETS_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=60` +
   `HF_HUB_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=60`, retry-on-transient with seed offset (P6.4)
5. `make test-train-watchdog` Makefile regression gate — 24 tests + signal-delivery
   integration test (P6.5)
6. `sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)` — defensive in-script fix for
   nohup-buffering blind period (P6.6, added post-Medium-resume incident)

End-to-end Track B validation: all 6 layers exercised at scale during a real
laptop-shutdown event mid-Medium training (2026-04-23 11:32 WIB). Resume
restored 91k more steps to step 111000 over 18h12m, finished cleanly. Only
~36min compute lost between checkpoint save and shutdown. CLAUDE.md §6.11
"Training Script Interruption-Safety Rule" codifies the 5-layer pattern as
cross-repo (added in fajar-lang `441f22e`).

**Benchmarks (V31.C.P3.2-P3.5, P9):**
- `intllm.lm_eval_wrapper` — `HFLM` adapter for `lm-evaluation-harness` v0.4.11.
- `bench-canonical-real` — 8-task lm-eval (wikitext + lambada + hellaswag + piqa
  + winogrande + arc_easy + arc_challenge + openbookqa) on `*_final.pt` checkpoints.
  All 3 scales benched in v0.4.0:
  - `paper/intllm/results/bench_canonical_intllm-mini.json`
  - `paper/intllm/results/bench_canonical_intllm-base.json`
  - `paper/intllm/results/bench_canonical_intllm-medium.json`
- **Phase D scaling chain — clean monotonic LM-modeling improvement:**
  - wikitext word_PPL: 343 → 201 → **138** (-60% Mini→Medium)
  - lambada PPL: 51121 → 16729 → **5277** (-90% Mini→Medium)
  - lambada acc: 0.001 → 0.007 → **0.023** (16× Mini→Medium)
  - Multi-choice reasoning (hellaswag/piqa/winogrande/arc/openbookqa):
    noisy at sub-100M scale, mostly within ±1-2 stderr (per Chinchilla
    expectation).
- `bench-knowledge-real` — mmlu/triviaqa/boolq scaffold ready (not yet executed).
- `make verify-intllm-tables --strict` — 12/13 paper claims PASS (1 PEND:
  Table 4 kernel E2E Mini tok/s, FajarOS-side artifact).

**fp16-vs-ternary parity gate (V31.C.P3.5, IntLLM differentiator):**
- 37 hooks, rel_l2 mean 2.31, p50 0.82, max 19.31 on Mini v2.

**MLSys AE artifact (V31.C.P5.1-P5.3):**
- `ARTIFACT_APPENDIX.md` + 100-prompt fixed evaluation set.
- `run_smoke.sh` — 93s end-to-end Functional smoke (vs 30-min target).

**Documentation:**
- `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` — 9-week plan
- `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_GATE_CALIBRATION.md` — evidence-backed scale-aware
  thresholds (Mini < 4.5 / Base < 4.2 / Medium < 4.0 / Stretch < 3.7)
- `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_CONFIG.md` — params + token budgets per scale
- `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_BASE_C1_GATE.md` + `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_MEDIUM_C1_GATE.md` —
  §6.8 R6 decision-gate docs
- `docs/FJQ_PHASE_D_OPS.md` + `docs/PAPER_OUTLINE.md`

### Changed — Cross-cutting

- **Cargo.toml** — `version = "0.3.0"` → `"0.4.0"`. Description rewritten to
  reflect both Arms.
- **README.md** — restructured as umbrella ("FajarQuant — Quantization Research
  for Compiler-Verified LLM Systems") with two clearly separated arms. v3.1
  KV quant content preserved; Phase D added as primary going forward.
- **Compiler dependency** — bumped from Fajar Lang v27.5.0 → v31.0.0 (gains
  `@noinline`+`@inline`+`@cold` lexer V29.P1, `@no_vectorize` codegen V31.B.P2,
  `FJ_EMIT_IR` env var; needed by Phase D kernel-path).
- **Paper Table 2** — wikitext + hellaswag rows for all 3 scales now backed by
  real lm-eval v0.4.11 numbers (was placeholder zeros pre-v0.4.0).

### Cross-Repo Linkage

- **[Fajar Lang v31.0.0](https://github.com/fajarkraton/fajar-lang/releases/tag/v31.0.0)** —
  compiler dependency. Phase D uses V29.P1 `@noinline` lexer + V31.B.P2
  `@no_vectorize` codegen attribute.
- **[FajarOS Nova v3.9.0](https://github.com/fajarkraton/fajaros-x86/releases/tag/v3.9.0)** —
  IntLLM Kernel Path. Runs `medium_final.pt` inside `@kernel` context via
  shell `cmd_ask` → `tfm_mf_generate` dispatch + `make test-intllm-kernel-path`
  4-invariant gate.
- All three repos now Apache 2.0 (fajar-lang + fajaros-x86 relicensed from
  MIT on 2026-04-24; fajarquant has been Apache 2.0 since inception).

## [0.3.0] "FajarQuant v3.1 Adaptive Per-Head" — 2026-04-13

Adaptive per-head KV cache quantization. Profiles each KV head's statistical
properties (variance per channel, kurtosis, SVD ratio) at calibration time
and routes to optimal strategy. Discovers two architecture-specific optima
that no fixed method finds: PCA rotation on MQA 3-bit (−24% vs KIVI), PPL-
guided mixture on GQA 2-bit (−35% vs KIVI). Score: 2 wins / 5 ties / 2 losses
on 9-cell cross-architecture grid.

### Added
- `adaptive.rs` — per-head profiler + strategy selector (Path A=KIVI / B=PCA / C=TQ)
- PPL-guided 2-bit fallback when MSE and PPL disagree
- 28 paper claims + `verify_paper_tables.py` strict CI gate

## [0.2.0] "FajarQuant v2.12 Cross-Architecture KV Cache Quantization" — 2026-04-13

First systematic cross-architecture perplexity evaluation. 3 models (Gemma 4 E2B
MQA + Mistral 7B GQA-8 + Qwen2-7B GQA-4) × 3 bit widths (2/3/4) = 9 cells, all
on canonical R-α.1 model surgery protocol with WikiText-2 test set.

### Added
- Outlier-aware calibrated PCA (`turboquant.rs` v2): replaces TurboQuant's
  random rotation with per-head PCA, calibrated once on representative data.
- Fused quantized attention (`fused_attention.rs`): computes attention on
  quantized KV vectors via codebook dot products, 524,288× memory reduction
  at 16K context.
- Hierarchical multi-resolution bit allocation (`hierarchical.rs`): more bits
  for recent tokens, exponential decay. 48.7% bit savings @ 10K, 55.7% @ 16K.
- 6 Fajar Lang demos in `examples/*.fj`.

Extracted as standalone crate from Fajar Lang V26 Phase A4 split. Algorithm,
paper, data, and reproducibility scripts moved here. Fajar Lang depends via
Cargo path/git dep + thin re-export shim.

### Added
- KIVI baseline (`kivi.rs`)
- 16 integration tests
- Cargo workspace structure
- Initial paper draft
